In order for a job to be accepted, it must be not only competent and informative.\nRules of registration Despite the existence of their own requirements at each university, which can be found in the methodological literature of your university, there are standards for the design of the practice report:\n  The volume of the report is 15-25 pages.\n  The volume of the introduction and conclusion of 1-2 pages.\n  The report should be executed by any printing method on a typewriter or using a computer and a printer on one side of a sheet of A4 white paper, at one and a half intervals.\n  Font Times New Roman 14.\n  Font color should be black.\n  Margins are applied: right - 10 mm, upper and lower - 20 mm, left - 30 mm.\n  The orientation of the document is portrait, the document is stitched on the left.\n  The alignment method is in width, without indentation on the left and right.\n  The red line starts after 1.25 cm.\n  No intervals are made before and after the paragraph.\n  Section headings are located in the middle of the sheet and are printed in bold capital letters without a dot at the end, without underlining. If the title consists of two sentences, they are separated by a dot. Each section starts with a new sheet.\n  The headings of subsections and paragraphs should be printed with paragraph indentation with a capital letter without a dot at the end, without underlining, width alignment (bold are not highlighted). If the title consists of two sentences, they are separated by a dot.\n  The pages of the report should be numbered in Arabic numerals, observing the end-to-end numbering throughout the text of the report. The page number is placed in the center of the lower part of the sheet without a dot. The title page is included in the general page numbering of the report. The page number is not put down on the title page. The content of the report is numbered 2.\n  Between the sections and subsections available in the report, there is an indent of two blank lines with an interval of 1.0.\n  Subsections are separated from the text by two blank lines with an interval of 1.0.\n  All elements of the report (introduction, main part, references, conclusion, appendices) begin with a new sheet.\n  The name of the table should be placed above the table on the left, without paragraph indentation in one line with its number separated by a dash with an interval of 1.0. Example: “Table 2 – title”. Each table or figure should be addressed in the text of the work (before the table and figure) and a link to the source from which the table or figure is taken. It is allowed to use a font size in the table smaller than in the text (min -10) line spacing in the table 1.0.\n  When transferring a part of the table to another page, the word table, its number and name are indicated once on the left above the first part of the table, and the words “Continuation of the table” are also written on the left above the other parts and indicate the table number.\n  Separate the table from the text before and after an interval of 6 pt.\n  At the end of the name of the table, a footnote is made to the source of the table:\n    for the author’s tables, you should sign It Compiled by the author, and indicate the main literature that you used for calculations or compiling the table;\n  the borrowed tables are accompanied by links to the source, indicating the page numbers from where the information was taken.\n   The name of the drawing is placed in the center under the drawing without a dot at the end, in the following format: the word Drawing, its number and the name of the drawing through a dash.\n  If the name of the drawing consists of several lines, then it should be written in one line spacing. The name of the drawing is given with a capital letter without a dot at the end. Hyphenation of words in the name of graphic material is not allowed.\n  Equations and formulas should be separated from the text in a separate line. Above and below each formula or equation, at least one free line should be left with an interval of 1.0. If the equation does not fit in one line, then it should be moved after the equal sign (=) or after the plus signs (+), minus (-), multiplication (x), division (:) or other mathematical signs, and the sign at the beginning of the next line is repeated.\n  The explanation of the values of symbols and numerical coefficients should be given directly under the formula in the same sequence in which they are given in formula. The value of each character and numerical coefficient must be given from a new line. The first line of the explanation begins with the word “where” without a colon from the paragraph. Formulas should be placed in the middle of the line and indicated by ordinal numbering within the entire work with Arabic numerals in parentheses in the …","date":1589846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589846400,"objectID":"677b480c0a60831b4e4ce258e50b5ccc","permalink":"https://example.com/post/report/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/report/","section":"post","summary":"When making a report, you need to follow certain rules of registration.

Websites and apps that bring you news and show you your email are built, at least in part, with HTML markup using tags as a mechanism for markup of raw text content.\nThe problem with some markup languages (among them HTML) is that entering these tags manually is a very tedious task. And with other languages, such as XML, tags and their attributes make up more of the overall content than the text itself.\nExamples of markup languages Markup languages are used wherever it is required to obtain formatted text based on text alone: in typography (SGML, TeX, PostScript, RTF), computer user interfaces (Microsoft Word, OpenOffice), the World Wide Web (HTML, XHTML, XML, WML, VML, PGML, SVG, XBRL).\nLightweight markup languages If you wanted to take advantage of markup languages, for example by publishing an HTML page on the internet or converting a DocBook file to PDF so that it could be printed, you had to do one of two things. On the one hand, you can spend time learning these languages from the inside and outside, writing them down manually, and then checking your work three times. Or you could invest the money in a tool that manages the complexity of them for you.\nFortunately, some enterprising developers have come up with a third option. They created new markup languages that contained many (in some cases most or all) of the functions of heavier analogues, but greatly simplified the syntax. They are used where a person has to prepare text in a regular text editor (blogs, forums, wikis), or where it is important that a user with a regular text editor can also read the text. Here are some widely used lightweight markup languages:\n  BBCode\n  Markdown\n  reStructuredText\n  Textile\n  Wiki markup\n  Various auto-documentation systems (for example, Javadoc).\n  HTML The most common language is HTML (an abbreviation of the English Hypertext Markup Language − “hypertext markup language”). It is standard for Internet documents, with its help all web pages are created. Documents that contain a special code are processed by browsers and presented to users in a convenient interface. Thus, you get the opportunity to view pages, print them, use them to transfer data to servers.\nTextile It is one of the simplest markup languages, has somewhat more functionality. Its main task is to automatically convert text into markup while maintaining the breakdown into paragraphs. The language is used in CMS Textpattern.\nBBCode The abbreviation from the English Bulletin Board Code is a markup language that is used for formatting (formatting) messages on various electronic bulletin boards, forums, comments, personal messages, and so on. Tags similar to HTML tags are used to format the text. Unlike HTML tags, BBCode is enclosed in square brackets.\nLaTeX It is a markup language that is capable of automating many operations related to the layout of documents, such as automatic page numbering, creation of tables, illustrations, formulas, cross-references, headers, footers, subject indexes, tables of contents and references. Being distributed under the LaTeX Project Public License, LaTeX refers to free software.\nMarkdown Markdown is an easy way to add formatting. — for example, headings, bold/italic text and lists — in plain text. Instead of relying on HTML or WYSIWYG editors, Markdown allows you to create full pages of formatted text without having to take your fingers off the keyboard, and it’s all much more intuitive than HTML.\nConclusion While the idea of using markup languages with text documents was developing, this increased the use of markup languages in other areas, they suggested using them to represent various types of information, including playlists, vector graphics, web services, user interfaces.\n","date":1589155200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589155200,"objectID":"f5a41fa111af2eb248df32e4ee862e33","permalink":"https://example.com/post/markup_languages/","publishdate":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/markup_languages/","section":"post","summary":"Interested in learning about lightweight markup languages?

The only thing that calmed me was that there were no particularly important documents, since I reinstalled it before starting my studies. Because of this oversight, I had to reinstall everything.\nAs I said earlier, I completed laboratory work №3 and №4, the 1st stage of an Individual project on OS. In the process of doing laboratory work №3, I learned how to make reports using the lightweight Markdown markup language. It was necessary to make a report in Markdown format on laboratory work №2, it turned out not to be very difficult.

This version control system is used by various open source projects. You can start by learning the most commonly used commands, and then gradually expand your knowledge. This is exactly what we will do in this article.\nWhat is Git? GIT is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds to manage the development of the Linux kernel and is currently very widespread among software developers. Git has two main tasks: the first is to store information about all changes in your code, starting from the very first line, and the second is to ensure the convenience of teamwork on the code.\nWhat is a Version Control System? The Version Control System (VCS) is a software to facilitate working with changing information. The version control system allows you to store multiple versions of the same document, go back to earlier versions if necessary, determine who made a change and when, and much more. Such systems are most widely used in software development for storing the source codes of the program being developed.\nVersion control software keeps track of all changes made to the code in a special database. If an error is detected, developers can go back and perform a comparison with earlier versions of the code to fix errors, minimizing problems for all team members.\nCentralized version control systems Centralized version control systems are client-server applications, when the project repository exists in a single instance and is stored on the server. Access to it was carried out through a special client application.\nCVS (Concurrent Versions System, Simultaneous Versions System) is one of the first systems that became widespread among developers, it originated in the late 80s of the last century. Currently, this product is not being developed, this is primarily due to a number of key drawbacks, such as the inability to rename files, inefficient storage, and almost complete lack of integrity control.\nSubversion (SVN) is a version control system created to replace CVS. SVN was developed in 2004 and is still in use. Despite many advantages over CVS, SVN still has disadvantages, such as problems with renaming, inability to delete data from storage, problems in the branch merge operation, etc. In general, SVN was (and remains) a significant step forward compared to CVS.\nDistributed version control systems Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) allow you to store a repository (a copy of it) for each developer working with this system. At the same time, it is possible to allocate a central repository (conditionally) to which changes from local ones will be sent and, with it, these local repositories will be synchronized. When working with such a system, users periodically synchronize their local repositories with the central one and work directly with their local copy. After making a sufficient number of changes to the local copy, they (changes) are sent to the server. At the same time, the server is most often chosen conditionally, since in most DVCS there is no such thing as a “dedicated server with a central repository\u0026#34;.\nGit hosting A number of services provide hosting for git repositories, among the most famous are GitHub, Codebase, SourceForge, SourceHut, Gitea, Bitbucket, GitLab.\nWhat is an SSH key and why is it needed? To work from your computer with GitHub, to have access to projects stored on the service, to execute commands in the console without constantly confirming the password, you need to log in with the server. SSH keys help with this. Each SSH key contains a pair: a public (public) and a private (private) key. The public key is sent to the server, you don’t have to hide it from everyone and not worry that someone will see it and steal it. It is useless without its private key pair. But the private key is the secret part. Only you should have access to it.\nBasic git commands The git add command adds the contents of the working directory to the index (staging area) for a subsequent commit.\nThe git status command shows the status of files in the working directory and index: which files have been modified but not added to the index; which are waiting for a commit in the index.\nThe git diff command is used to calculate the difference between any two Git trees.\nThe git commit command takes all the data added to the index using git add and stores their cast in the internal database, and then shifts the pointer of the current branch to this cast.\nThe git rm command is used in Git to delete files from the index and working copy.\nThe git mv command is just a convenient way to move a file and then execute git add for the new file and git rm for the old one.\nThe git clean command is used to remove garbage from the working directory.\nConclusion We have analyzed the basic knowledge of what a Version Control System and Git are.
